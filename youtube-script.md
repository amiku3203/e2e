**Duration:** 13-15 minutes  
**Target Audience:** Full-stack developers, security enthusiasts  
**Difficulty:** Intermediate to Advanced  

---

## **INTRO (0:00 - 0:30)**

**[Energetic music, screen recording of the finished app in action]**

**"Hey developers! Welcome back to my channel. Today we're building something absolutely incredible - a self-destructing notes app with military-grade end-to-end encryption. Think Pastebin meets Mission Impossible!**

**This isn't just another tutorial project. This is a production-ready application that you could actually deploy and use for secure communication. We're talking about notes that automatically delete themselves after being read once, with encryption so strong that even if someone hacked our database, they couldn't read a single message.**

**By the end of this video, you'll have built a complete full-stack application using Next.js, MongoDB, and client-side encryption. So grab your coffee, and let's dive in!"**

---

## **HOOK & DEMO (0:30 - 1:15)**

**[Screen recording showing the complete app workflow]**

**"Before we start coding, let me show you exactly what we're building.**

**[Type in a secret message]**  
**I can type any sensitive information here - maybe an API key, a password, or confidential data.**

**[Click create note]**  
**When I click 'Create Secure Note', the magic happens. The content gets encrypted right here in my browser using AES-256 encryption, then saved to our database. Notice I get this shareable link.**

**[Copy and open link in new tab]**  
**Now when someone opens this link, the note gets decrypted in their browser and immediately deleted from our servers forever. Look at that - the note is gone. If I try to open the same link again...**

**[Try to open again]**  
**It's completely gone. This is true self-destructing technology.**

**The really cool part? The encryption key never touches our server. It's stored in the URL fragment after the hash symbol, which means it stays completely client-side. Our server literally cannot decrypt these messages even if it wanted to."**

---

## **TECH STACK OVERVIEW (1:15 - 2:00)**

**[Show animated tech stack graphics/logos]**

**"Here's our tech stack for this beast of an application:**

**• Next.js 14 with the new App Router and TypeScript - our full-stack React framework**  
**• MongoDB with Mongoose - for our database with automatic document expiration**  
**• ShadCN UI and Tailwind CSS - for that beautiful, modern interface you saw**  
**• CryptoJS - for client-side AES-256 encryption with PBKDF2 key derivation**  
**• Sonner - for those elegant toast notifications**  
**• Nanoid - for generating cryptographically secure unique IDs**

**The architecture follows a zero-knowledge principle. We're implementing end-to-end encryption where the server acts purely as encrypted storage. Even if someone gained access to our database, all they'd see is encrypted gibberish.**

**We're using MongoDB's TTL indexes for automatic document deletion, and the encryption happens entirely in the browser using industry-standard algorithms."**

---

## **PROJECT SETUP (2:00 - 3:30)**

**[Screen recording of terminal and VS Code setup]**

**"Alright, let's start building. I'm going to create a new Next.js project with all the bells and whistles:**

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest secure-notes --typescript --tailwind --eslint --app --src-dir
cd secure-notes
```

**Now let's install all our dependencies in one go:**

```bash
npm install mongoose crypto-js nanoid sonner next-themes
npm install @radix-ui/react-icons @radix-ui/react-slot @radix-ui/react-label
npm install lucide-react clsx tailwind-merge class-variance-authority tailwindcss-animate
```

**Next, we need to set up ShadCN UI. I'll create the configuration file:**

**[Show components.json creation]**

**And install the UI components we'll need:**

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add button card input textarea label
```

**Perfect! Now let's set up our project structure. We'll have:**
**• API routes for creating and retrieving notes**
**• Client-side encryption utilities**  
**• MongoDB connection and schema**
**• Beautiful UI components**

**The key here is organizing everything properly from the start so our code stays clean and maintainable."**

---

## **ENCRYPTION SYSTEM (3:30 - 5:00)**

**[Code walkthrough with syntax highlighting and explanations]**

**"Now for the heart of our application - the encryption system. This is what makes our app truly secure and sets it apart from simple note-sharing apps.**

**I'm creating an encryption utility in `src/lib/encryption.ts`:**

```typescript
import CryptoJS from 'crypto-js';

export interface EncryptionResult {
  encryptedContent: string;
  iv: string;
  salt: string;
  key: string;
}

export function encryptNote(content: string): EncryptionResult {
  const encryptionKey = generateKey();
  const salt = CryptoJS.lib.WordArray.random(128/8);
  const iv = CryptoJS.lib.WordArray.random(128/8);
  
  const derivedKey = CryptoJS.PBKDF2(encryptionKey, salt, {
    keySize: 256/32,
    iterations: 10000
  });
  
  const encrypted = CryptoJS.AES.encrypt(content, derivedKey, {
    iv: iv,
    mode: CryptoJS.mode.CBC,
    padding: CryptoJS.pad.Pkcs7
  });
  
  return {
    encryptedContent: encrypted.toString(),
    iv: iv.toString(),
    salt: salt.toString(),
    key: encryptionKey
  };
}
```

**Let me break this down:**

**1. We generate a random encryption key for each note**  
**2. Create a unique salt and initialization vector (IV)**  
**3. Use PBKDF2 with 10,000 iterations to derive the actual encryption key**  
**4. Encrypt using AES-256 in CBC mode**

**This is military-grade encryption. The 10,000 iterations make brute force attacks practically impossible, and every single note has completely unique encryption parameters.**

**The decryption function reverses this process:**

```typescript
export function decryptNote(encryptedContent: string, key: string, iv: string, salt: string): string {
  const derivedKey = CryptoJS.PBKDF2(key, CryptoJS.enc.Hex.parse(salt), {
    keySize: 256/32,
    iterations: 10000
  });
  
  const decrypted = CryptoJS.AES.decrypt(encryptedContent, derivedKey, {
    iv: CryptoJS.enc.Hex.parse(iv),
    mode: CryptoJS.mode.CBC,
    padding: CryptoJS.pad.Pkcs7
  });
  
  return decrypted.toString(CryptoJS.enc.Utf8);
}
```

**Beautiful, right? This is the same level of encryption used by banks and governments."**

---

## **DATABASE SCHEMA (5:00 - 6:00)**

**[Show MongoDB schema and explain TTL indexes]**

**"For our database, we're using MongoDB with a schema that's both simple and powerful. Here's our Note model:**

```typescript
import mongoose from 'mongoose';

const NoteSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  id: {
    type: String,
    required: true,
    unique: true,
    index: true
  },
  encryptedContent: {
    type: String,
    required: true
  },
  iv: {
    type: String,
    required: true
  },
  salt: {
    type: String,
    required: true
  },
  createdAt: {
    type: Date,
    default: Date.now
  },
  expiresAt: {
    type: Date,
    default: Date.now
  }
});

// This is the magic - TTL index for auto-deletion
NoteSchema.index({ "expiresAt": 1 }, { expireAfterSeconds: 0 });
```

**The TTL (Time To Live) index is absolutely crucial here. It tells MongoDB to automatically delete documents when the `expiresAt` time is reached. Since we set `expireAfterSeconds: 0`, documents are deleted immediately when `expiresAt` passes.**

**Notice what we're NOT storing:**
**• The original content - it's encrypted**
**• The encryption key - it never touches our server**
**• Any personally identifiable information**

**This is true zero-knowledge architecture. Our database is just encrypted storage."**

---

## **API ROUTES (6:00 - 7:30)**

**[Code walkthrough of both API endpoints]**

**"Let's build our API endpoints. We need two routes: one to create notes and one to retrieve and delete them.**

**First, the POST route in `src/app/api/notes/route.ts`:**

```typescript
import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server';
import { nanoid } from 'nanoid';
import dbConnect from '@/lib/mongodb';
import Note from '@/models/Note';

export async function POST(request: NextRequest) {
  try {
    await dbConnect();
    
    const { encryptedContent, iv, salt } = await request.json();
    
    if (!encryptedContent || !iv || !salt) {
      return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Missing required fields' }, { status: 400 });
    }
    
    const noteId = nanoid(21); // Cryptographically secure ID
    
    const note = new Note({
      id: noteId,
      encryptedContent,
      iv,
      salt,
      expiresAt: new Date(Date.now() + 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000) // 7 days fallback
    });
    
    await note.save();
    return NextResponse.json({ id: noteId }, { status: 201 });
  } catch (error) {
    return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Failed to create note' }, { status: 500 });
  }
}
```

**Now the really cool part - the GET route that retrieves AND deletes in one atomic operation:**

```typescript
export async function GET(request: NextRequest, { params }: { params: { id: string } }) {
  try {
    await dbConnect();
    
    // This is the magic - findOneAndDelete
    const note = await Note.findOneAndDelete({ id: params.id });
    
    if (!note) {
      return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Note not found or already deleted' }, { status: 404 });
    }
    
    return NextResponse.json({
      encryptedContent: note.encryptedContent,
      iv: note.iv,
      salt: note.salt
    });
  } catch (error) {
    return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Failed to retrieve note' }, { status: 500 });
  }
}
```

**The `findOneAndDelete` operation is atomic, meaning the note is deleted the instant it's retrieved. There's no window where someone could grab it twice. This is our self-destruct mechanism in action!"**

---

## **FRONTEND UI (7:30 - 9:00)**

**[Screen recording of building the beautiful UI]**

**"Now for the fun part - building our gorgeous user interface. I'm going for a security-focused dark theme with purple accents.**

**Here's our main page component with the note creation form:**

```tsx
'use client';

import { useState } from 'react';
import { Button } from '@/components/ui/button';
import { Card, CardContent, CardDescription, CardHeader, CardTitle } from '@/components/ui/card';
import { Textarea } from '@/components/ui/textarea';
import { encryptNote } from '@/lib/encryption';
import { toast } from 'sonner';

export default function Home() {
  const [content, setContent] = useState('');
  const [shareableLink, setShareableLink] = useState('');
  const [isCreating, setIsCreating] = useState(false);

  const createNote = async () => {
    if (!content.trim()) return;

    setIsCreating(true);
    try {
      // Encrypt on the client side
      const { encryptedContent, iv, salt, key } = encryptNote(content);
      
      // Send encrypted data to server
      const response = await fetch('/api/notes', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
        body: JSON.stringify({ encryptedContent, iv, salt })
      });

      if (response.ok) {
        const { id } = await response.json();
        // Key goes in URL fragment - never sent to server!
        const link = `${window.location.origin}/note/${id}#${key}`;
        setShareableLink(link);
        setContent(''); // Clear for security
        toast.success('Secure note created successfully!');
      }
    } catch (error) {
      toast.error('Failed to create note');
    } finally {
      setIsCreating(false);
    }
  };
```

**The key insight here is that we encrypt the content BEFORE sending it to the server. The server never sees the original text. And notice how the encryption key goes in the URL fragment after the hash - that part never gets sent to the server in HTTP requests.**

**I'm using a beautiful gradient background and modern card design:**

```tsx
<div className="min-h-screen bg-gradient-to-br from-slate-900 via-purple-900 to-slate-900">
```

**The UI clearly communicates the security features with icons and descriptions, building trust with users."**

---

## **NOTE VIEWING & DECRYPTION (9:00 - 10:30)**

**[Show the note viewing page and decryption process]**

**"The note viewing page is where the real magic happens. When someone clicks a link, here's the complete flow:**

```tsx
'use client';

import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import { useParams } from 'next/navigation';
import { decryptNote } from '@/lib/encryption';
import { toast } from 'sonner';

export default function NotePage() {
  const params = useParams();
  const [content, setContent] = useState('');
  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(true);
  const [error, setError] = useState('');

  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchNote = async () => {
      try {
        const noteId = params.id as string;
        // Extract key from URL fragment
        const encryptionKey = window.location.hash.substring(1);

        if (!encryptionKey) {
          setError('Invalid link: Missing encryption key');
          return;
        }

        // Fetch encrypted data - this deletes the note!
        const response = await fetch(`/api/notes/${noteId}`);
        
        if (!response.ok) {
          setError('Note not found or already deleted');
          return;
        }

        const { encryptedContent, iv, salt } = await response.json();
        
        // Decrypt in the browser
        const decryptedContent = decryptNote(encryptedContent, encryptionKey, iv, salt);
        setContent(decryptedContent);
        
        toast.success('Note decrypted successfully!', {
          description: 'This note has been permanently deleted.'
        });
      } catch (error) {
        setError('Failed to decrypt note');
        toast.error('Decryption failed');
      } finally {
        setIsLoading(false);
      }
    };

    fetchNote();
  }, [params.id]);
```

**Here's what's brilliant about this:**

**1. We extract the encryption key from the URL fragment**  
**2. Fetch the encrypted data from our API**  
**3. The note gets deleted from the database during the fetch**  
**4. We decrypt the content in the browser**  
**5. Show the decrypted message to the user**

**Once this page loads successfully, the note is gone forever. There's literally no way to recover it, even from database backups, because we only stored the encrypted version."**

---

## **TOAST NOTIFICATIONS (10:30 - 11:00)**

**[Show toast notifications in action]**

**"I've added beautiful toast notifications using Sonner to give users proper feedback throughout the entire process:**

```tsx
// Success notifications
toast.success('Secure note created successfully!', {
  description: 'Your encrypted note is ready to share.'
});

// Error handling
toast.error('Failed to create note', {
  description: 'Please check your connection and try again.'
});

// Copy to clipboard
toast.success('Link copied to clipboard!', {
  description: 'The secure link is ready to share.'
});

// Decryption success
toast.success('Note decrypted successfully!', {
  description: 'This note has been permanently deleted.'
});
```

**These replace ugly browser alerts with elegant, themed notifications that match our app's design. Users always know exactly what's happening, which builds confidence in the security features.**

**The toasts are styled to match our dark theme with custom colors and animations."**

---

## **SECURITY FEATURES DEEP DIVE (11:00 - 12:00)**

**[Highlight security aspects with graphics and code examples]**

**"Let's talk about what makes this app truly secure. This isn't just marketing - these are real security features:**

**🔐 End-to-End Encryption:**
**• Content is encrypted with AES-256 before leaving the browser**  
**• Uses PBKDF2 with 10,000 iterations for key derivation**  
**• Unique salt and IV for every single note**

**🛡️ Zero Knowledge Architecture:**
**• Server never sees unencrypted content**  
**• Encryption keys never touch our servers**  
**• Even database administrators can't read messages**

**💥 Self-Destructing Messages:**
**• Notes are deleted immediately after being read**  
**• Uses atomic database operations to prevent race conditions**  
**• MongoDB TTL indexes provide automatic cleanup**

**🔑 Secure Key Management:**
**• Encryption keys stored in URL fragments**  
**• URL fragments aren't sent in HTTP requests**  
**• Each note has a completely unique encryption key**

**🚀 Additional Security Measures:**
**• Cryptographically secure random ID generation**  
**• Content cleared from memory after encryption**  
**• No logging of sensitive data**  
**• HTTPS required in production**

**This architecture means that even if someone:**
**• Hacked our database**  
**• Intercepted our network traffic**  
**• Gained access to our servers**

**They still couldn't read any messages because they don't have the encryption keys!"**

---

## **DEPLOYMENT & FINAL DEMO (12:00 - 13:00)**

**[Show deployment process and comprehensive demo]**

**"Deploying this is straightforward. Here's the complete process:**

**1. Set up MongoDB Atlas (free tier works great):**
```bash
# Get your connection string from MongoDB Atlas
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/secure-notes
```

**2. Deploy to Vercel:**
```bash
# Push to GitHub
git add .
git commit -m "Complete secure notes app"
git push origin main

# Connect to Vercel and add environment variables
```

**3. Configure environment variables in Vercel dashboard**

**Now let me show you the complete app in action with a real deployment:**

**[Comprehensive demo showing:]**
**• Creating a note with sensitive content**  
**• Copying the shareable link**  
**• Opening in incognito/different browser**  
**• Note being decrypted and deleted**  
**• Attempting to access the same link again (fails)**  
**• Beautiful error handling**  
**• Toast notifications throughout**

**"Look at that - it works perfectly! The note is completely gone, and we get proper feedback at every step. This is production-ready code that you could actually use for real secure communication."**
